# Aries-Signal processing open source library

## What is Aries-Signal?

Areies-Signal is an open-source implementation of speech signal processing algorithms on aggresive-noise scenes such as robot-engine's or wind strong noise.
 
It aims to help tech otakua who want to use speech signal processing algorithms to enrich their lives and make sth. different.

Aries-Signal is mainly implemented using C, and called by C++(provided as a shared-library file).

## Introduction of Aries-Signal modules

Currently Aries-Signal is planning to be composed of such modules as Voice Activity Detection(VAD), Direction Of Arrival(DOA) and Noise Supression(NS).

More than digital signal process in a stable enviroment, this project is also want to discuss the issues about how to apply DSP methods on a engine-drived object which may cause physical vibration and aggresive unstable noise. Therefore, this project would be the speech solution for some several field's problems in this scenario.

Aries-Signal is suggested to be used with other Aries-X projects, which aim to deal with the problem with wireless-telecommunication(Ble, etc.), pwm-control(qualified single-chips with the lowest cost), ui-design(Aries series robot control app & robot appearance design), road-planning(advanced behaviors design), self-conscious(think-and-act as human, behaviour analyis-accept or reject).
